# Hotel-Room-Booking-System-C-
In this program I will prompt the user to enter a command code in order to execute a hotel reservation activity,
and depending on their input the program can book rooms or delete bookings for user names. The user will have a choice to quit the program at anytime and can also 
display the room reservations anytime throughout the program.
